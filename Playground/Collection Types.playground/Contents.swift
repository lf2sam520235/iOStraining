//Iterating Over a Dictionary
//
//You can iterate over the key-value pairs in a dictionary with a for-in loop. Each item in the dictionary is returned as a (key, value) tuple, and you can decompose the tuple‚Äôs members into temporary constants or variables as part of the iteration:
//    
    for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
        print("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")
}
// YYZ: Toronto Pearson
// LHR: London Heathrow
//For more about the for-in loop, see For-In Loops.
//
//You can also retrieve an iterable collection of a dictionary‚Äôs keys or values by accessing its keys and values properties:

    for airportCode in airports.keys {
        print("Airport code: \(airportCode)")
}
// Airport code: YYZ
// Airport code: LHR

for airportName in airports.values {
    print("Airport name: \(airportName)")
}
// Airport name: Toronto Pearson
// Airport name: London Heathrow
//If you need to use a dictionary‚Äôs keys or values with an API that takes an Array instance, initialize a new array with the keys or values property:

let airportCodes = [String](airports.keys)
// airportCodes is ["YYZ", "LHR"]

let airportNames = [String](airports.values)
// airportNames is ["Toronto Pearson", "London Heathrow"]
